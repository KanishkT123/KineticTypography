For Letter Box Detection:

All of the code is in histogram.py
Save the image you want to run the letter box detection in the same folder/sub-folder as histogram.py

It should already be under __main__, but update the variable imagePath to be your image, then call getBounding(imagePath, numClusters)
numClusters should be the number of colors in the image, including the background color.
