ChiasMain.py is the file that I changed so it will not generate the txt or xml file. Instead, it generates the output with the word that is forming 
Chiasmus and the index of the words in the sentence. 

If you look at the code inside the ChiasMain.py file, it will be clear that it is modified based on the original Main.py file from the 
author of the Chiasmus paper (Marie Dubremetz).
