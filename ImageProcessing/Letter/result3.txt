This provides a description of the basic algorithm. As with the Perceptron, a NumPy
implementation can take adwntage 0f wrious matrix multiplications, which makes things
easy to read and faster to compute. The implementation on the website is a batch version
of the algorithm, so that weight updates are made after all of the input vectors have been
presented (as is described in Section 4.2.4). The central weight update computations for the
algorithm can be implemented as:
